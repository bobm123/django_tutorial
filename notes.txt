Doing the django tutorial here.
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/

Path To Djangos templates. Copy these over then edit them  when need 
to customized one fo the views. In part II the tutorial has you change
a few things on the admin page 
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin

Commong patter for connectign pages to the main site:
    Create an 'app' (did this with polls somewhere before tutorial03)
    edit polls/views.py - add code to deliver tha page
    edit polls/urls.py  - add a pattern to match for this page's index
    edit mysite/urls.py - add a pattern that directs to the app (polls)

At some point the connection to the root was broken (no longer shows
the Django 'it worked' page) Note sure how to get back to that yet but
it now gives a 404 error (except that debug is on)

The polls page's view.py delivers the view for the app. The first 
version just delivered some static text. This is about where the first 
couple chapters of TDD were in their django app

    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")

The next version links that with python variable values:

    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        output = ', '.join([p.question_text for p in latest_question_list])
        return HttpResponse(output)
    
But that means hardcoding a bunch of html in the python code. Django 
uses a curley braced template system to put python variable into html.

    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        template = loader.get_template('polls/index.html')
        context = RequestContext(request, {
            'latest_question_list': latest_question_list,
        })
        return HttpResponse(template.render(context))

Since loading template, filling in a context and then returning a http
respnse is such a common idiom, there's a shorcut:

    def index(request):
        latest_question_list = Question.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
        context = {'latest_question_list': latest_question_list}
        return render(request, 'polls/index.html', context)

Also, with that last example just need to import render like the default
view.py shows. Doing it with seperate load, context, render, response
means you have to import all that too.

At this point the index.html template (with all the {% python code %} 
stuff gets replaces with html in the render() call and in this example
the first poll question is delivered as a bullited list with a 
link to the answers.

last part of chapter 3  concerned with adding views and url resolution.
Added a new function in polls/views.py for details. This is where the 
each question in the list links to so it can show display the choices 
for that question. The url pattern for the polls is:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/

Clicking on one of the questions resolves to its question number (there's 
only one in the database ATM) so the details are here:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/1/

Also worked through an example of chnaging "1" to specifics_1 by adding
a new pattern in urls.py [not sure, but it loosk like the last pattern 
in the list gets the match overriding any previous, only one at a time]

Finally showed hot to avoid hardcoding paths "polls/" in mysite/index.html
by replacing
    <a href="/polls/{{ question.id }}/">

with
    <a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">

And then using the namespace operator in urls.py:

    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls', namespace="polls"))
    
so index.html can use:
    <a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">    
    
Note "polls:" could be "foo:" if namespace="foo", nothing magic about use
of 'polls' in these last two places.
